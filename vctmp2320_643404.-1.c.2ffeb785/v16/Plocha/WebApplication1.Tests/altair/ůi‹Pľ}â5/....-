Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoftupdates,supplements, andInternet-based servicesfor this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. If so, those terms apply. Microsoft Corporation or one of its affiliates (collectively, “Microsoft”) has licensed the software to Licensor.By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, return it to the place of purchase for a refund or credit. As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of certain computer information for Internet-based services.These terms supersede any electronic terms which may be contained within the software. If any of the terms contained within the software conflict with these terms, these terms will control. If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each server you properly license.OVERVIEW.Software. The software includesserver software; andadditional software that may only be used with the server software directly, or indirectly through other additional software.License Model. The software is licensed based onthe number of physical and virtual processors used by operating system environments in which you run instances of server software.Licensing Terminology.Instance. You create an “instance” of software by executing the software’s setup or install procedure. You also create an instance of software by duplicating an existing instance. References to software in this agreement include “instances” of the software.Run an Instance. You “run an instance” of software by loading it into memory and executing one or more of its instructions. Once running, an instance is considered to be running (whether or not its instructions continue to execute) until it is removed from memory.Operating System Environment. An “operating system environment” is all or part of an operating system instance, or all or part of a virtual (or otherwise emulated) operating system instance which enables separate machine identity (primary computer name or similar unique identifier) or separate administrative rights, and instances of applications, if any, configured to run on the operating system instance or parts identified above. There are two types of operating system environments, physical and virtual. A physical operating system environment is configured to run directly on a physical hardware system. The operating system instance used to run hardware virtualization software (e.g. Microsoft Virtual Server or similar technologies) or to provide hardware virtualization services (e.g. Microsoft virtualization technology or similar technologies) is considered part of the physical operating system environment. A virtual operating system environment is configured to run on a virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system. A physical hardware system can have either or both of the following:one physical operating system environmentone or more virtual operating system environments.Server. A server is a physical hardware system capable of running server software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate physical hardware system.Physical and Virtual Processors. A physical processor is a processor in a physical hardware system. Physical operating system environments use physical processors. A virtual processor is a processor in a virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system. Virtual operating system environments use virtual processors. A virtual processor is considered to have the same number of threads and cores as each physical processor on the underlying physical hardware system.Assigning a License. To assign a license means simply to designate that license to one device or user.USE RIGHTS.Licensing a Server. Before you run instances of the server software on a server, you must determine the number of licenses required and assign them to that server. You have two options to determine how many licenses you need. Those options are described below.Determining the Number of Licenses Required. The number of licenses required is based on either the total number of physical processors on the server (as described in (i) below) or the number of virtual and physical processors used (as described in (ii) below).Unlimited Virtualization. Under this option, the number of software licenses required for a server equals the total number of physical processors on that server. Counting and assigning licenses based on this option permits you to run the server software in one physical and any number of virtual operating system environments without regard to the number of physical and virtual processors used.Licensing based on Processors Used. Under this option, the number of software licenses required for a server equals the sum of the software licenses required under (A) and (B) below:(A) To run instances of the server software in the physical operating system environment on a server, you need a software license for each physical processor that the physical operating system environment uses.(B) To run instances of the server software in virtual operating system environments on a server, you need a software license for each virtual processor that each of those virtual operating system environments uses. If a virtual operating system environment uses a fraction of a virtual processor, the fraction counts as a full virtual processor.Assigning the Required Number of Licenses to the Server.After you determine the number of software licenses you need for a server, you must assign that number of software licenses to that server. That server is the licensed server for all of those licenses. You may not assign the same license to more than one server. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate server.You may reassign the software license, but not within 90 days of the last assignment. You may reassign a software license sooner if you retire the licensed server due to permanent hardware failure. If you reassign a license, the server to which you reassign the license becomes the new licensed server for that license.Running Instances of the Server Software. Your right to run the software depends on the option used to determine the number of licenses required.Unlimited Virtualization. If you assign to a server licenses equal to the total number of physical processors on the server:You may run, at any one time, any number of instances of the server software in one physical and any number of virtual operating system environments on that server.You do not need to license virtual processors.Licensing based on Processors Used. You may run, at any one time, any number of instances of the server software in physical and virtual operating system environments on each server to which you have assigned the required number of software licenses. The total number of physical and virtual processors used cannot exceed the number of software licenses assigned to that server.Running Instances of the Additional Software. You may run or otherwise use any number of instances of additional software listed below in physical or virtual operating system environments on any number of devices. You may use additional software only with the server software directly, or indirectly through other additional software.RFID Client and ToolsRFID SDKRFID MobileCreating and Storing Instances on Your Servers or Storage Media. You have the additional rights below for each software license you acquire.You may create any number of instances of the server software and additional software.You may store instances of the server software and additional software on any of your servers or storage media.You may create and store instances of the server software and additional software solely to exercise your right to run instances of the server software under any of your software licenses as described (e.g., you may not distribute instances to third parties).Included Microsoft Programs. The software contains other Microsoft programs. These license terms apply to your use of those programs.Office Web Component.  You may use the component only to view and print copies of static documents, text and images created with the software. You do not need separate licenses for those copies of the component as long as you use them only for those purposes.  ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.No Client Access Licenses (CALs) Required for Access. You do not need CALs for other devices to access your instances of the server software.Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use topool connections,reroute information, orreduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software(sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses of any type that you need.No Separation of Server Software. You may not separate the server software for use in more than one operating system environment under a single license, unless expressly permitted. This applies even if the operating system environments are on the same physical hardware system.Distributable Code. The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are “Distributable Code.”Sample Code. You may modify, copy, and distribute the source and object code form of code marked as “sample.”	Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must	add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;	require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;	display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and	indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.Distribution Restrictions. You may not	alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;	use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;	distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than the Windows platform;	include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or	modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, thatthe code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; orothers have the right to modify it.INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.Consent for Internet-Based Services.
